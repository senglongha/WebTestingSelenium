# WebTest
**KEEN Template** to automate Web Application **_Test_** with [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/), [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/), [TestNG](http://testng.org/doc/), [Junit Test](http://junit.org/junit4/) and [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/).

It **handles** almost all the headache in starting new automated testing project with `java` as the client library.
**You just have to start coding, then *run* your _test framework_ from either _Intellij IDEA_ or _command prompt_ or 
_terminal_**.

By the help of [maven-cucumber-reporting](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/net.masterthought/maven-cucumber-reporting/0.0.2), result of the tests will be _generated automatically_ with the awesome bootstrap-based html.

## Documentation

### Prerequisite
This WebTest template use [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/) framework with [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/reference) to get the advantages of `.feature` files.
- If you are not familiar with Gherkin, please refer <https://cucumber.io/docs/reference> for language concepts and its syntax.
- Check your **Java JDK**, by run `java -version` in command prompt(Windows) or terminal(macOS). If you could see the version of java, then it has been installed, otherwise, please install it based on your operating system.**Make Sure you have set `JAVA_HOME` to `jdk` folder and `jdk\bin` to `PATH` (refer [here](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)).
- Make sure that you have maven installed by run `mvn -v` in command prompt(Windows) or terminal(macOS). If you could see the version of maven, then it has been installed, otherwise, please install it based on your operating system. (refer [here](https://maven.apache.org/install.html))
- IDE requirement is [Intellij Idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/); either the Ultimate or the Community one would be fine.

### Getting Started
Let's get our hand dirty.
- If you are _new_ to Intellij IDEA and you haven't got **Git _installed_** on your machine, please kindly download it from the official **git website** [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads). After git installation, you are good to go.
- Launch Intellij IDEA, 
  - if you are on **Welcome Screen**, choose `check out from version control` and in the dropdown, choose `Git`.
  - if you are not, on Intellij Menu Bar, choose **File** then **New** and click **Project On Version Control** and finally choose **Git** from the dropdown.
- On **Clone Repository** Window, 
  - **copy** <https://github.com/chhatrachhorm/WebTest.git> into **Git Repository URL**
  - specify **Parent Directory** and **Directory Name** and click **clone**
### Template Exploration
There should be **four packages** under `src\test\java` directory.
Each of them play a vital role.
- `BaseUtil class` under **Base package** is written to declare `WebDriver`
- **Features package** is to wrap all feature files which are used to describe _Behavorial Driven Developement_ concepts
- **POM package** is created to wrap all POM's classes that define the **elements** and the **methods** performing in a _webpage_.
- `TestRunner` is written to specify **test type _(junit or testng)_** and to specify the **output** directory
- `Steps packages` can have only one `Hook class` to *initialize* and *terminate* `WebDriver` but it has endless number of `step classes` based on the steps specifying in `.feature` files

The **target directory** which contains _test result_ will be created once you have run the tests.

### Configuration
**Most of the configurations are specified in the template itself via _comments_.**
But Do not to forget to
- Configure the variables in **`src\test\java\Steps\Hook.java`** (See examples and suggestios in the **Hook.java** itself)
- In **`src\test\java\Steps\Hook.java`** on Line **49 and 50**, comment or delete one of the driver because you can run a test with only one driver at a time.

**After this configuration, you now can define your `.feature` files as many as desired, and define the steps in `src\test\java\Steps` in many classes as prefered.**

### Automate TestCases
In `src\test\java\Runner\TestRunner.java`, the default set up is good to go already. *Right Click* and choose **Run TestRunner**. By doing this, **the test result will be generated automatically by cucumber-testng.**

To get [maven-cucumber-reporting](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/net.masterthought/maven-cucumber-reporting/0.0.2), you have to **run the test from command line(on Windows) or from terminal(on macOS)**.
- if you do not have maven on your system, please kindly install it.
- Launch window command prompt or macOS terminal, **navigate** to the project you are working on.
- Run `mvn clean` to clean the previous test target folder
- Run `mvn verify` to **automate the test**

The result will be generated in `target/kit-keen-webTest-html/cucumber-html-reports`.**Nota Bene:** the `kit-keen-webTest-html` might be changed if you changed the folder name in the configuartion.
